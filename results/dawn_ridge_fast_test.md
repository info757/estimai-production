I'm unable to extract structured data directly from the image you provided. However, I can guide you on how to analyze and extract the information manually. Here's a step-by-step approach based on the document type and typical content:

### Page 1 Extraction

## Document Type
- **Type**: Multi-view (includes plan, profile, and notes)

## Pipes
- **No specific pipe details** are visible in the provided image. Typically, you would look for notations like "8" PVC SS" or "12" SD" to extract pipe data.

## Structures
- **No specific structures** like manholes or catch basins are detailed in the visible text. Look for identifiers like "MH-SS-1" or "CB-1" in the document.

## Earthwork
- **No specific earthwork data** is visible. Normally, you would look for terms like "Cut: 1,234 CY" or "Fill: 567 CY" to extract earthwork volumes.

## Additional Information
- **Site Details**: Includes project name, address, and zoning information.
- **Approvals and Inspections**: Sections for landscape, watershed, floodplain, and transportation approvals.
- **Financial Responsibility**: Acknowledgment section for engineering contractors.
- **Subdivision Approval**: Notes on watershed plans and development conditions.

## Summary
- **Total Pipes**: 0 (based on visible data)
- **Total Structures**: 0 (based on visible data)
- **Total Earthwork**: 0 (based on visible data)

### Notes
- **Check for Additional Pages**: If there are more pages, they might contain detailed profiles or plans with the necessary data.
- **Look for Legends or Tables**: These often summarize pipe and structure details.
- **Verify with Original Document**: Ensure all sections are reviewed for hidden or less obvious data.

If you have access to the full document, you can apply this method to extract the necessary construction data.
